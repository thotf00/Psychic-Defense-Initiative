# About Me 
My name is [David Danforth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-danforth-876a7b222/). I have a variety of influences and experiences which prepared me to begin this work. 

- Deeply spiritual youth:
  - Read the Bible rigorously from ages 7-17
  - Was a very worshipful and prayerful youth
- Travelled extensively across the USA from ages 19-35 (hitchiking/greyhound/auto)
- Depth of Study in Esoteric Philosophy with deep roots in:
  - Qabalah
  - Sacred Geometry

## Educational Resources

These materials I found to be critical to comprehending the nature of reality, which prepared me to discenring the nature of phenomenon which I've experieinced. Some of the resources touch on this subject from a purely meta-physical or philisophical perspective. Others explain more scientific or mathematical explanations for those same concepts. 

### Practical and Comprehensive
- [Analysis and Assessment of Gateway Process](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/cia-rdp96-00788r001700210016-5.pdf) - CIA.gov FOIA Release (Scientific Background, Describes using Psi for Military Purpose)
  - [Gateway Experience: Wave I - Discovery](https://www.monroeinstitute.org/products/gateway-experience-wave-i-discovery?variant=45531518009661)
    - This program demonstrated to me that processing of traumas is key to gaining OBE through meditative means. The processes are similar to EMDR and guided meditation including visualization both theraputic and of traditional origins.

### Psychic Development
- Psychic Self Defense - Dion Fortune (somewhat dated, but a classic.)
- Alice A Bailey - Telepathy (provides guidance and worldview from a practicioners view)

### Esoteric Philosophy
- Tao Te Ching \ Hua Hu Ching (Nondualistic thinking)
- Mystical Qabalah - Dion Fortune (Metaphysics, philosophical framework, practical guidance, along with a practice in associative thinking via correspondances)
  >  Dion Fortune's classic, The Mystical Qabalah, explores all aspects of the Qabalah, including the esoteric sciences of astrology and tarot, which form the basis of the Western Mystery Traditions. It provides a key to the practical working of this mystical system for both novice and initiate alike. 
- The Doctrine and Ritual of High Magic, Elphias Levi (Describes the workings of secret societies and sacred orders)

### Sacred Geometry 
**...and 'Hidden' Grids of Power across the Earth**
- [Secrets In Plain Sight Documentary Series](https://www.sacredgeometryacademy.com/course/secrets-in-plain-sight) \[[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48z8BtS__a4)\]
  > Secrets In Plain Sight  is an awe inspiring exploration of great art, architecture, and urban design which skillfully unveils an unlikely intersection of geometry, politics, numerical philosophy, religious mysticism, new physics, music, astronomy, and history.
  > 
  > Exploring key monuments and their positions in Egypt, Stonehenge, Jerusalem, Rome, Paris, London, Edinburgh, Washington DC, New York, and San Francisco brings to light a secret obsession shared by pharaohs, philosophers and kings; Templars and Freemasons; great artists and architects; popes and presidents, spanning the whole of recorded history up to the present time.
  > 
  > As the series of videos reveals how profound ancient knowledge inherited from Egypt has been encoded in units of measurement, in famous works of art, in the design of major buildings, in the layout of city streets and public spaces, and in the precise placement of obelisks and other important monuments upon the Earth, the viewer is led to perceive an elegant harmonic system linking the human body with the architectural, urban, planetary, solar, and galactic scales.

### Science and Sacred
- The Holographic Universe - Michael Talbot 
  > Two of the world's most eminent thinkers believe that the universe itself may be a giant hologram, quite literally a kind of image or construct created, at least in part, by the human mind \[...] theory explains not only many of the unsolved puzzles of physics but also such mysterious occurrences as telepathy, out-of-body and near-death experiences, lucid dreams, and even religious and mystical experiences, such as feelings of cosmic unity and miraculous healings. 
- The vodou quantum leap - Reginald Crosley (more depth on above)
  > In this unique synthesis of African-Haitian spirituality, Western religion, Eastern mysticism, and modern science, Dr. Crosley presents Vodou as a metaphysical experience--a bridge to parallel universes and mystical dimensions, confirmed by the eerie tenets of quantum physics.
- Cycles of Time by Roger Penrose (Getting into the Weeds)
  > - Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC): The theory proposes that what we call the Big Bang was not the beginning of everything, but rather the beginning of our current "aeon," following the end of a previous one.
