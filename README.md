# Psychic Defense Initiative

People get OBE \ Astral Travel \ Psi capacities thru various means... trauma, dreaming, meditation, drugs, genetics, etc.

- As discussed in Kathy O’Brien’s “Trance-Formation of America” [@CaptainBoomer](https://twitter.com/CaptainBoomer/)

As we are familiar in life, there are a range of moral qualities to people, and range of knowledge\experience\skills which are paired with a corresponding set of vulnerabilities

This realm is like the wild west...  there are rules and customs, but its not like participants realize how many observers there are, and even if etheric actions are objected to.. its not always enforceable

Moreover, its not always clear what the morals are in such an environment... its a morally ambiguous sphere.

There are a variety of cultures, with their own subcultures, and guidelines which are generally upheld, but the moral standard in many is questionable to say the least... 

Along the lines if you lust after a woman in your heart, its the same as committing adultery.

I'm not worried so much about that... but you might choose actions more carefully if you realize the other party is experiencing these things.. and then there are all kind of super nasty things people can play with because "who's going to stop them" especially if they are part of a large group which can defend itself from justice.

## Goals
### My Goals

1. Educating people how to get there without trauma
  - requires dealing with your own trauma before you can get there
2. Exploring the moral systems I've encountered
  - determining what are the correct moral guidelines for myself
  - documenting those efforts for others who may find them useful

### Project Goals

I see this project mainly as equipping people with the tools to navigate this effort, and imagine affinity groups forming in various local and non-local configurations

## Deceivers and Tricksters

There are many deceivers and tricksters.. they use similar tactics and you never know if someone is for your good or not, regardless of how they present

Even they might not know if they are being tricked into helping or hurting you
even worse is that if they have access to your consciousness, they are exposed to whoever you are connected to, and can even bait others in your vicinity, depending on skill level

One might get encouraged to take some psychic action which you know is wrong, but convince you its ok in that context, or persuade you with false promises
depending on your vulnerabilities, these can have various impacts from bad to worse, if you know what i mean


## Super Evil Ones:

1. Addicted to torture, both giving and receiving,
2. Coerce individuals into doing evil, then hold it over your head to do more bad ideas.
3. Pretend to be friends, and lure innocents into seemingly innocuous actions.
4. They seduce people with psychic sex that's usually nasty gross and nothing like lovemaking.
5. Apparently automated, very little genuine communication.

### Background

- Men Who Stare at Goats 
  >  Jon Ronson concerning the U.S. Army's exploration of New Age concepts and the potential military applications of the paranormal. The book is a companion to a three-part TV series broadcast in Britain on Channel 4—Crazy Rulers of the World (2004)—the first episode of which is also entitled "The Men Who Stare at Goats". The book received a loose feature film adaptation released in 2009. \[[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Men_Who_Stare_at_Goats)]
- Mystical Qabalah - Dion Fortune (Philosophical framework for conceptual comprehension)
  >  Dion Fortune's classic, The Mystical Qabalah, explores all aspects of the Qabalah, including the esoteric sciences of astrology and tarot, which form the basis of the Western Mystery Traditions. It provides a key to the practical working of this mystical system for both novice and initiate alike. 
- The Holographic Universe - Michael Talbot 
  > Two of the world's most eminent thinkers believe that the universe itself may be a giant hologram, quite literally a kind of image or construct created, at least in part, by the human mind \[...] theory explains not only many of the unsolved puzzles of physics but also such mysterious occurrences as telepathy, out-of-body and near-death experiences, lucid dreams, and even religious and mystical experiences, such as feelings of cosmic unity and miraculous healings. 
- The vodou quantum leap - Reginald Crosley (more depth on above)
  > In this unique synthesis of African-Haitian spirituality, Western religion, Eastern mysticism, and modern science, Dr. Crosley presents Vodou as a metaphysical experience--a bridge to parallel universes and mystical dimensions, confirmed by the eerie tenets of quantum physics.
