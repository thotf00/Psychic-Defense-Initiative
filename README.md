People get Out of Body Experiences OBE \ Astral Travel \ Psi capacities thru various means... trauma, dreaming, meditation, drugs, genetics, etc.

- As discussed in Kathy O’Brien’s “Trance-Formation of America” [@CaptainBoomer](https://twitter.com/CaptainBoomer/)

As we are familiar in life, there are a range of moral qualities to people, and range of knowledge\experience\skills which are paired with a corresponding set of vulnerabilities

This realm is like the wild west...  there are rules and customs, but participants rarely comprehend who or how many may be watching at a given time. Even if actions are objected to in this space, its not always enforceable. Moreover, its a morally ambiguous sphere. Individuals could easily get in over their head, self-motivated or otherwise, before they comprehend the consequences of thier actions.

There appear to be a variety of cultures acting in the Astral Realm, with their own subcultures and guidelines which are generally upheld. That said, the moral standard in many is questionable to say the least...

The situation brings to mind the exhortation "anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart." 

While I'm not too concerned about lustful thoughts, one might choose thier thoughts more carefully if it was understood that the other party "overheard" those thoughts, and might even feel as though you were enacting them physically. Beyond that, there are many nasty techniques that can be engaged in because of plausible deniability and a "who's going to stop me?" mentality. This could be especially so if they are part of a group which is able to defend itself from justice.

## Who is this For?
I'm not here to convince anyone, but am mainly interested in collaborating with those who have interest

## What is the Playing Field
The relevant experiences range from gaslighting from seemingly random 3rd parties, to direct thought to thought communication.

- Public Spaces (Social pressure)
- Mental Sphere (Manipulation via direct and indirect means)
- Social Interactions (Manipulation of associates, bia similar techniques as used individually)

Because the tactics involve both direct, and indirect manipulation, one can never tell who is being influenced and is consciously engaging with our reality and who is simply reacting to unseen forces.

## Who is Vulnerable?

- Spiritual and Magickal Practicioners
- Drug users and Addicts
- Channels
- Inexperienced Dungeons and Dragons Players 
- Anyhone with an extensive history with trauma
- Those succeptible to manipulation by guilt, fear, shame, pride, or greed

## Goals
### My Goals

1. Educating people how to get there without trauma
  - requires dealing with your own trauma before you can get there
2. Exploring the moral systems I've encountered
  - determining what are the correct moral guidelines for myself
  - documenting those efforts for others who may find them useful

### Project Goals

I see this project mainly as equipping people with the tools to navigate this effort, and imagine affinity groups forming in various local and non-local configurations

## Deceivers and Tricksters

There are many deceivers and tricksters.. they use similar tactics and you never know if someone is for your good or not, regardless of how they present

Even they might not know if they are being tricked into helping or hurting you
even worse is that if they have access to your consciousness, they are exposed to whoever you are connected to, and can even bait others in your vicinity, depending on skill level

One might get encouraged to take some psychic action which you know is wrong, but convince you its ok in that context, or persuade you with false promises
depending on your vulnerabilities, these can have various impacts from bad to worse, if you know what i mean

## "Evil Ones":

1. Gain power from and are addicted to torturing others as well as being "punished" by etheric violence.
2. Coerce individuals into doing evil, then hold it over your head to do more bad ideas.
3. Pretend to be friends, and lure innocents into seemingly innocuous actions.
4. They seduce people with psychic sex that's usually nasty gross and nothing like lovemaking.
5. Apparently automated, very little genuine communication.

## Tactics and Techniques 
- often demonstrated across sense-modalities

### Tactics of Entrapment
Most Commonly, they promise future pleasures or pain.

- Fear
- Guilt
- Shame
- Lust
- Greed

### Technique
#### Direct
- Touch (pleasure\pain)
- Thought Injection
- Feeling Injection
- Sense
- Cloud thoughts
- Coerce
- Intimidate
- Insult
- Repetitive Stupidity

#### Indirect
- Gang-stalking (sometimes similar to a flash-mob)
- Lie to others around you
- Feed people messages related to you, making it seem like those individuals are "in-the-know"
